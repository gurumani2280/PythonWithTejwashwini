Install pip install pytest 
pip install pytest-html

1. auto discovery of pythin file , test function and test class will happen
2. python file should sart with test_*.py or *_test.py
3. functions should start with test eg : test login()
4. class name should start with Test eg: Test login 
5. how to run test case with a specific method name?
   pytest -v -s -k "method name"
   eg : pytest -v -s -k "login"
   here it will run all the test functions/methods having "login" in their method/function name
6. creating marker is better way of doing the selective running 
   eg: on top of method @pytest.mark.smoke
   while running pytest -m "smoke"
we can give multiple marker to a function 
eg : 
    @pytest.mark.login
    @pytest.mark.smoke
    def test_loginwithvalidusers(self):
        print("Login with valid users")
eg : we can run this by giving pytest -m "smoke and login" -v -s

pytest -m "smoke or login"
pytest -m "not smoke"
pytest -m "not login"

7. how to use fixtures in pytest?
use @pytest.fixture
    def setup():
       print("before method")
       yield
       print("after method")
fixture name should be passed as an argument to the test method
fixtures are used as a setup (before method) and tear down(after method) using yield keyword or statement
before yield will be executed before test method and statements presebt after yield will be executed after test method is run

instead of keeping fixture in a file , we can keep it inside a directory inside a file conftest.py so that it will be available to all the files inside
that particulat directory
eg : pytest NewDemo2/ -v -s
